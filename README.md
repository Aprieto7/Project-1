The objective of our project is to understand crime rates linked to specific locations and time, looking for correlations among crime types and locations. Two large cities and a neighbor city of smaller population in the State of Texas are selected for the analysis. 

## Target questions:
*   Analyze historical crime type and rates for a selected group of cities. 
*	Compare iconic cities trends vs. lower populate areas by crime type.
*	Predict crime rates for the next 2-3 years.
*   Optional:Correlate additional external factors.
