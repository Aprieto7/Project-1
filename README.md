Project Proposal:	The objective of our project is to understand crime rates linked to specific locations and time looking for 
correlations with random events that could modify historical trends between 2018 and 2020.

Target questions:
•	Analyze historical crime type and rates for a selected group of cities/countries. 
•	Understand the impact of the 2020 pandemic on crime rates for a selected number of cities/countries. 
•	Compare iconic cities trends vs. lower populate areas by crime type.
•	Correlate additional external factors.
•	Predict crime rates for the next 2-3 years.
