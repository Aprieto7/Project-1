## Project Proposal:	The objective of our project is to understand crime rates linked to specific locations and time looking for correlations with random events that could modify historical trends between 2017 and 2020..

## Target questions:
•	Analyze historical crime type and rates for a selected group of cities. 
•	Compare iconic cities trends vs. lower populate areas by crime type.
•	Predict crime rates for the next 2-3 years.
    Optional:Correlate additional external factors.
